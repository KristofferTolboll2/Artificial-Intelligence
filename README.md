# Artificial-Intelligence
My Exam Notebook along with a few of the other project, that have been made for the semester.

In order to run the notebook, correctly please run in google colab, if you wish to train the model.
I have linked a <i>DropBox </i> [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5o206odgzvb7yn/mse-13-0.0591.h5?dl=0) with the best model that was created. You can also download the notebook, and run locally on your machine. In order to try out the model you have to download the file, and put it into the Keras <i>load model </i> section of the notebook.
