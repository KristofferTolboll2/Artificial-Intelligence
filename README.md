# Artificial-Intelligence
My Exam Notebook along with a few of the other project, that have been made for the semester.

In order to run the notebook, correctly please run in google colab, if you wish to train the model.
I have linked a [<i>DropBox </i> Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d5o206odgzvb7yn/mse-13-0.0591.h5?dl=0) with the best model that was created. You can also download the notebook, and run locally on your machine. In order to try out the model you have to download the file, and put it into the Keras <i>load model </i> section of the notebook. 


Please follow this lnk to open the notebook in google colab (to have preset enviroment set up). If you wih to run the best model you must download it from the dropbox link and it add to your google drive. Otherwise you can train a model in use it inside the prediction formulars in the bottom. 

The exam notebook will contain:
- Intuition and overall theory about the model and technologies in use
- Steps to get dataset
- Preprocessing
- Data Analysis
- Cross validation 
- Model creation
- Model training
- Training and Model validation
- Different predictions on the dataset

For the intuition and theory behind this project,
